<!-- CDN -->
<!-- React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's commonly used for creating single-page applications where the content is dynamically updated as the user interacts with the application.

CDN Links: Instead of hosting the React library files (JavaScript files) on their own servers, developers may use CDN links to include these files directly in their web pages or applications. A CDN link is a URL that points to the location of a specific version of a library hosted on a Content Delivery Network.

For example, a CDN link for React might look like this:

html
Copy code
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
In this link:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@17 is the base URL of the CDN.
umd/react.development.js specifies the path to the React library file.
Advantages:

Faster Load Times: CDNs have servers distributed globally, so users can download the React library from a server that is geographically closer to them, reducing latency and improving load times.
Caching: CDNs often cache files, so if a user has already downloaded the React library from the CDN, subsequent requests can be served from the local cache, further improving performance.
Versioning: The version number in the CDN link (react@17 in the example) helps ensure that the application gets the specific version of React it expects. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and compatibility with the application's code.

By using CDN links for React (or other libraries/frameworks), developers can offload the burden of hosting and delivering these files to a global network, resulting in a more efficient and faster experience for users accessing their web applications. -->
